# Timer Hackathon Project
This is a timer project I worked on for a hackathon back during my Freshman year of college using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to run:

Clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bengutow1/timerproj_for_hackathon.git
```
Open the newly created directory: 
```bash
cd timerproj_for_hackathon
```
Open index.html (on Windows):
```bash
start index.html
```
* You can also double click index.html on most OSs to open it.
