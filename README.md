# Timer Hackathon Project
This is a timer project I worked on for a hackathon back during my Freshman year (Spring 2024) of college using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to run:

Clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bengutow1/2024_timerproj.git
```
Open the newly created directory: 
```bash
cd 2024_timerproj
```
Open index.html (on Windows):
```bash
start index.html
```
* You can also double click index.html on most OSs to open it.

## Features:

* 3 sounds to choose from
* Can name each timer
